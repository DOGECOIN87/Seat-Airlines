description: A static page, one Worker, and a seating chart both of them share.

# How it is built

Seat Airlines is two deployments:

| Part | What it is | Where it runs |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **The page** | A static single-page app: React 19, Vite, Tailwind CSS 4 and three.js | GitHub Pages, at `seat-airlines.space` |
| **The Worker** | One Cloudflare Worker, `seat-airlines-banners` | Cloudflare, with KV, R2 and D1 bound to it |

The page reads three outside services:

| Service | For | From |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Jupiter token API | Market cap, the five-minute move, the holder count | The browser, every 20 s |
| Solana | Balances and the holder list | The Worker, which holds the RPC endpoint as a secret |
| Open-Meteo | Weather outside the aircraft | The browser |

## What the Worker does

* **The wall** — stores adverts against the wallet that signed them: records in KV, artwork in R2 (or in KV when R2 has no public URL).
* **The holder list** — reads every holder from the chain, caches it for a minute, and serves it to every visitor, so no RPC key is ever shipped to a browser.
* **The cabin directory** — cards, introductions, rooms and the PA, in a D1 database, behind a signed-in session.
* **The flight controls** — the crew's shared manual controls, which every open page reads.

## One seating chart, shared

Who sits where decides who may read whose contact details, so it is a boundary rather than a layout — and a boundary enforced only in the browser is not one. The seat ladder therefore lives in `src/lib/seating.ts`, plain TypeScript with no browser and no Cloudflare in it, and **the page and the Worker import the same file**. So do `src/lib/holderList.ts`, which reads the holder list, and `src/lib/manualControls.ts`, which clamps the flight controls. There is one copy of each rule, not two that could drift.

## Performance, briefly

* Every view animates off refs through **one** `requestAnimationFrame` loop, so the instruments never re-render React at 60 fps.
* Polling pauses in background tabs and aborts superseded requests.
* The 3D scene adapts its pixel ratio to measured render time, and React and three.js ship as separate cached chunks.
* `prefers-reduced-motion` keeps the animation loop but softens it: half the bank and pitch, slower easing, and no shakes or flashes; the logo flyover still plays.
