/**
 * Reading the aircraft off the chain.
 *
 * The case this exists for: `getMultipleAccounts` refuses more than a hundred
 * addresses. With a cabin of forty nobody ever noticed; with the whole
 * aircraft of 178 an unbatched call errors, which this module reads as "the
 * chain could not be asked" — so a full manifest would quietly fall back to
 * the twenty largest accounts and the aeroplane would look like it had sold
 * out at row 4. A wrong aircraft is also a wrong set of section permissions,
 * since the ladder is what decides who may read whose card.
