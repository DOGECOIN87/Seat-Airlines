/**
 * Who sits where, as the server needs to know it.
 *
 * ── Why this exists at all ────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * This service spent its whole life refusing to learn the seat ladder, and
 * the refusal was right: a second copy of that logic would drift from the
 * page's the first time either changed, and adverts never needed it — the
 * page knows which seat a wallet is in, so the wall can be keyed by wallet
 * and stay honest.
 *
 * The directory is not the wall. "Your own section and everything behind it"
 * is a rule about who may read somebody's email address and somebody else's
 * conversation, and a rule like that enforced only in the browser is not a
 * rule — it is a suggestion the network tab ignores. So the ladder is
 * computed here too.
 *
 * What makes that safe is that it is not a second copy: the seating itself
 * comes from `src/lib/seating.ts`, the same file the page imports, so there
 * is one definition of rank, one zone order, and one place to change them.
 * What is here is only the part that is this side's own business — fetching
 * the holder list, caching it, and answering "which cabin is this wallet in".

 * ── Why there is a default at all ─────────────────────────────────────────
 * `RPC_URL` is a secret rather than a var, because a paid endpoint carries
 * its key in the URL, and a secret is set out of band — by hand, once, on the
 * dashboard. CI cannot push it (an unset repository secret would write an
 * empty string on every deploy and silently turn the gate off), so a deploy
 * that is correct in every other respect can land with no way to read the
 * chain. That is not a loud failure. It is a directory that opens, lists
 * everybody, and withholds every contact detail from everybody, because it
 * cannot tell one cabin from another — and `sections: false` on `/health` is
 * the only place it says so.
 *
 * A deployment should not depend on somebody having remembered. Solana's own
 * public endpoint is the answer of last resort: rate-limited, unsuitable for
 * real traffic, and enormously better than not knowing who is aboard. Every
 * path that uses it already treats a refusal as "could not be asked" and
 * keeps whatever it had, so the failure mode of it being busy is the failure
 * mode that was already handled.
 *
 * Set `RPC_URL` to your own endpoint. This is what happens when you have not.
