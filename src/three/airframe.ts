 * looked out on. It could be polished but not fixed — flat vector fills have a
 * ceiling, and past a certain point more gradients only make a flatter drawing
 * more elaborate.
 *
 * So the aeroplane is built here instead, in metres, in the same scene the
 * cabin already lives in. It gets the real sun, the real scattering sky, the
 * real cloud deck and the real ground for free, and the aircraft you orbit is
 * literally the tube whose seats you are booking — same radius, same thirty
 * rows at the same pitch, windows punched where the rows actually are.
 *
 * Dimensions are an A320's: 37.6 m long, 34 m span, 1.85 m body radius.
