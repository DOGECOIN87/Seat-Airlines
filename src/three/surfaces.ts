 * The other worlds, as the scene takes them: textures, arriving when ready.
 *
 * `surfaceData.ts` does the arithmetic and `surfaceWorker.ts` runs it off
 * the main thread. The bank here starts the worker a moment after the page
 * settles and has it build every world in the order the flight is likely to
 * need them — the cloud sea is only $1M away, Mars a hundred — so by the
 * time the market climbs to one, it is waiting. Asking for a world that is
 * not ready yet moves it to the front of the queue, and the scene makes do
 * until it arrives. Without workers, each is built in place on first need.
