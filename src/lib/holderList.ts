/**
 * Everybody's balance, which is what a manifest needs.
 *
 * ── Why this is its own module ────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Same reason as `seating.ts`: the Worker has to arrive at the same aircraft
 * the page does, and the only safe way to do that is to run the same code
 * rather than a careful reimplementation of it. Seating decides who sits
 * where; this decides who is even on board, and getting either one slightly
 * different puts a wallet in business here and in first there — which, now
 * that the cabin decides who may read whose card, is a privacy boundary
 * disagreeing with itself.
 *
 * So nothing here reads the environment. The page binds its `VITE_` values in
 * `holdings.ts` and the Worker binds its vars in `ladder.ts`; both call this.
 *
 * ── Where a holder list comes from ────────────────────────────────────────
 * The mint alone is not enough, and this is the part that surprises people:
 * Solana has no "list the holders of this token" call. The closest is
 * `getTokenLargestAccounts`, which returns **at most twenty** token accounts
 * and is a hard RPC limit. Twenty accounts is not forty seats.
 *
 * There is a way to get the rest of them out of a plain RPC, though, and it
 * is the one every explorer uses: ask the token program for every account it
 * owns whose mint field is this mint. That is the whole holder list, and
 * it is not capped at twenty. It is only expensive — a scan the RPC has to do
 * — so some endpoints refuse it and none of them enjoy it.
 *
 * So there are three sources, tried in that order:
 *
 *   holdersUrl    JSON `[{ address, balance }, …]` from an indexer, uncapped
 *   rpcUrl+mint   every token account for the mint, summed by owner: the
 *                 whole aircraft, from the mint alone, no indexer required
 *   …and failing  the twenty largest accounts, which fills the front of the
 *   that          aircraft and leaves the rest empty
 *
 * All three then drop accounts owned by a program, because a bonding curve is
 * not a passenger.
