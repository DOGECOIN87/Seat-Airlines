/**
 * How much of the token a wallet holds.
 *
 * Two plain JSON-RPC calls — the mint's supply, and the caller's balance of it
 * — which is all the seat ladder needs. Doing it over `fetch` rather than a
 * client library keeps the whole app at two dependencies.
 *
 * ── Where the numbers come from ───────────────────────────────────────────
 * From the Worker, when this deployment has one — the same service the advert
 * wall and the directory already talk to. It answers `GET /holding?address=…`
 * with a balance, the supply, and the share.
 *
 * That is not indirection for its own sake. Reading the chain takes an RPC
 * endpoint; a paid one carries its API key in the URL; and Vite inlines every
 * VITE_ value into the bundle it ships. So `VITE_RPC_URL` handed that key to
 * everyone who opened the site. The documented defence was to restrict the
 * key by domain at the provider — and that restriction is the `Origin`
 * header, which is a string anybody with curl can type. It stops a
 * copy-paste, not a script. A key belongs where it can be a secret, and on
 * this deployment that is the Worker.
 *
 * The larger win is cost. One visitor reloading the page is no longer one
 * call to somebody's metered endpoint, and a hundred visitors are not a
 * hundred callers of it: the Worker reads once and caches for everybody.
 *
 *   VITE_RPC_URL_PUBLIC=https://your-public-rpc-endpoint   optional — read only when there
 *                                            is no Worker to ask instead
 *   VITE_TOKEN_MINT=<the SPL mint address>
 *
 * With neither, nothing is read and nothing is invented: the cabin is simply
 * empty until something answers.
