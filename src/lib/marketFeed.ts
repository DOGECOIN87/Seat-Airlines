/**
 * The live market feed.
 *
 * The only implementation of `FlightFeed`. Everything downstream — the
 * horizon, the tapes, the annunciators, the seat ladder, the radio log —
 * reads it without knowing where the numbers came from.
 *
 * ── Why the parser looks like this ────────────────────────────────────────
 * It reads fields by *name*, anywhere in the response, rather than by a fixed
 * path like `data[mint].stats5m.priceChange`.
 *
 * That is deliberate, and it is not defensive coding for its own sake.
 * Jupiter serves this data from several endpoints that have each moved
 * between versions — `price/v2`, `price/v3`, `tokens/v2/search` — and they do
 * not agree on nesting, only on what the fields are called. A fixed path
 * turns a shape change into a blank altimeter on a production page. Searching
 * by key survives the endpoint being swapped for a different one entirely,
 * which is exactly the kind of change somebody will make to this file later
 * without re-reading it.
 *
 * Every value is validated before it is used, and anything missing leaves the
 * previous reading in place rather than pushing a zero onto the tape. An
 * aircraft whose altimeter drops to nothing because a JSON key was renamed is
 * worse than one that holds its last known altitude.
