/**
 * The contract address, across the top of the page.
 *
 * It is the first thing somebody arriving from a link looks for and the one
 * string they need to copy exactly, so it sits above everything else and is
 * copyable in one press rather than one careful drag across 44 characters.
 * The way to buy sits next to it, because that is what they were going to do
 * with the address anyway.
 *
 * The address is shown whole wherever there is room. It is only ever
 * abbreviated on a narrow screen, and even then the full value stays in the
 * DOM — a truncated address that cannot be copied in full is worse than no
 * address at all, because it looks like one.
